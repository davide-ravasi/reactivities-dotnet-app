/*
How It All Fits Together ------------------
--A client (e.g., a web request) sends a Query object asking for the list of activities.

--MediatR routes this query to the Handler class.

--The Handler:
-----Uses the DataContext to query the database.
-----Returns the list of activities to the client.

Comparison to React ------------------
DataContext: Similar to a global state manager or a service that provides data to your components.
Constructor: Similar to passing props or using context to provide dependencies to your components.
Handle Method: Similar to making an API call to fetch data and then updating the state with the fetched data.
MediatR: Similar to middleware that intercepts actions and routes them to the appropriate handlers.
